Dear kaolixcrm Administrator:

This install documentation gives you a short introduction what you have got to do to install koalixcrm.

1. Support ¶

There will be a list of local Support in your Country as soon as I get some information about that. Currently there is only one: Me of cause ;-) Visit my website:  http://www.koalix.com to get more information about my services.
2. Requirements ¶
django ¶

django is an open source web application framework, written in Python, which follows the model-view-controller architectural pattern. It was originally developed to manage several news-oriented sites for The World Company of Lawrence, Kansas, and was released publicly under a BSD license in July 2005; the framework was named after gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt. In June 2008 it was announced that a newly formed Django Software Foundation will take care of Django in the future.  http://www.djangoproject.com/

apache fop ¶

Formatting Objects Processor (FOP) is a Java application that converts XSL Formatting Objects (XSL-FO) files to PDF or other printable formats. FOP was originally developed by James Tauber who donated it to the Apache Software Foundation in 1999. It is part of the Apache XML Graphics project.  http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/
git ¶

Git is a free & open source, distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Every Git clone is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server. Branching and merging are fast and easy to do.  http://git-scm.com/
step by step installation ¶
ubuntu 10.10 ¶

aptitude install fop python-django apache2-mod-python subversion postgresql python-psycopg2
/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf  
uncomment the following line
local all all ident
sudo su postgres
psql
ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'youradminpasswordforpostgresql'; 
CREATE USER koalixcrm WITH PASSWORD 'passwordforkoalixcrmdatabase';
CREATE DATABASE koalixcrm ENCODING 'UTF8'; \q
exit
sudo mkdir /var/www/koalixcrm
sudo chown yourOSUser: /var/www/koalixcrm
cd /var/
chown -R www-data: www
cd /var/www/
git git://www.koalix.org/koalixcrm.git
cd /var/www/koalixcrm
nano settings.py (you have to adjust your databaseuser and databasepassword)
python manage.py syncdb (This is where you set your admin password in the koalixcrm)
python manage.py schemamigration crm --initial
python manage.py schemamigration accounting --initial
python manage.py schemamigration djangoUserExtention --initial
python manage.py installdefaultscrm
python manage.py installdefaultsaccounting
python manage.py installdefaultsdjangouserextention
make a new file in /etc/apache2/site-available/koalixcrm with the following content:
<VirtualHost *:80> 
       ServerAdmin youradminemail@yourhoster.com
       CustomLog /var/log/apache2/koalixcrm_access.log combined
       PythonPath "['/var/www/koalixcrm'] + sys.path"
       SetHandler python-program
       PythonHandler django.core.handlers.modpython
       SetEnv DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE settings
       PythonDebug On
</VirtualHost>
cd /etc/apache2/site-enabled/
rm default (you will need the default if you want to run phppgadmin but to test the software you dont need it)
ln -s ../site-available/koalixcrm .
/etc/init.d/apache restart (to load your new configuration)

What you wanna do next is of cause the test the software. Visit your  http://localhost/admin, log in and start testing. To be able to do pdf exports you have to do something more. I advice you to do it the following way. To start, use my defaulttemplates in the /var/www/koalicrm/templatefiles. Whenever my installation does not work for you there is a logfile for more information under /tmp/koalixcrm_pdfgeneration_log.txt

cd /var/www/koalicrm/media/uploads/
ln -s ../../templatefiles .

visit  http://localhost/admin/djangoUserExtention/ and start adding the files manually or automaticly:

-- coming soon
