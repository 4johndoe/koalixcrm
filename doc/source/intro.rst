Intro
=====

The Intro should give you a first overview over koalixcrm's basic functions and structure.

Basic Structure
---------------
koalixcrm tries to keep near the real world objects. Lets say you wanna register a customer in koalixcrm then you find
a customer in your koalixcrm. When you just received a question for an quote, you find a quote in your koalixycrm. Same
for many kind of business objects you know in your company.
Every such real world objects is represented in the dashboard (admin start page) as row of the applicationtable, every 
objects has a name - of cause - an add and a modifie button. When you want to create a customer you just press the "add"
button in the customer row and you will soon get a form to fill out save your customer.
You find three groups of such objects: crm, accounting and djangoUserExtentions.
